# secure_password_generator

## Description
This project involved creating a secure password generator for the user. I was given the index.html, style.css, and script.js files. I modified and added to the script.js file in order to get the website to generate a random password based on the criteria preferences of the user. I asked the user how long they wanted their password to be (between 8 and 128 characters). I then asked the user if they wanted the following password critieria to be included in their password: lower case letters, upper case letters, numbers, or special characters. After receiving the user's password criteria a random password was generated to meet the user's criteria. The password is then displayed in the password text box on the index.html page.

This was accomplished by: 
    <ul>
        <li>Implementing prompts, confirms, functions, arrays, for Loops, and a random number generater to pull indexes from the criteria arrays. I then pushed the random characters to the user's generated password array.</li>
    </ul>

## Technologies Used

    <li>HTML</li>
    <li>CSS</li>
    <li>JavaScript</li>
</ul>

## What I Learne

While working on this project I learned how to use various JavaScript elements such as: arrays, functions, and for Loops. I also learned how to use Math.floor and Math.random to genarate random whole numbers. I used the generated random number as the index for the password criteria array.
